### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Alexandre Weisser (pazka)

- ðŸ§© I'm a curious, try hard, developer who compulsively starts projects to fill the needs of the people I care about.
- ðŸª€ I like to discover new tech by making joke projects that go way too far.
- ðŸ›  My projects go from small, quick tools to over-ambitious custom made systems, almost everytime developed for somebody else.
- ðŸ¥½ If I can fiddle in the cleanest way possible, by using the latest architecture I read upon, or any design principles I wanted to improve, that's even better ! 
- ðŸ”— Here's my website : [hosh.it](https://hosh.it/). For personal experiments, side projects.
