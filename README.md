### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Alexandre Weisser (Pazka)

- ðŸ§© I'm a curious, tryhard, developer who compulsively starts projects to fill the needs of the people I care about.
- ðŸª€ I like to discover new tech by making joke projects that go way too far.
- ðŸ›  My projects go from small tools to art projects, because once I get the gist of something I need to try something new !
- ðŸ¥½ If I can fiddle in the cleanest way possible, by using the latest architecture I read upon or any design principles I wanted to improve, that's even better !
